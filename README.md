# Chatspace

Real-time, collaborative GPT frontend built with
[Deno KV](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/kv/manual) and
[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev/). Chat history is stored in Deno KV, and the
[`watch()`](https://docs.deno.com/deploy/kv/manual/operations#watch) feature is
used to deliver updates to everyone in this workspace.
